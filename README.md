# pubpoint
Proposed App - PUBPOINT This app will allow groups to pinpoint the most equidistant pub to them all when approaching from different locations. We will utilse APIs from Google Maps, Twilio and Stripe to create via multiple build stages an app that encompases localisation, personalisation and mobile hardware.

Build stages

Create app that allows a single user to locate nearest pub.
Extend app to allow second user to locate same pub, tracking movements and adding push messaging.
Extend app to allow multiple users to find equidistant pub when approached from multiple locations.
Extend app to allow for ordering of refreshing beverages via push messaging.
Extend app to allow for the direct payment of said refreshing beverages via in-app payment.
